about building a model using some algorithms with intel dataset
using Naive bayes classifiers,SVR,KNN

Introduction

From textual data ,the preprocessing of the data has been started . After that feature extraction and classification process has begun and finally led to prediction of the accuracy . Generated the datasets by using a library called Synthetic data for Intel Processors like i3,i5,i7,i9. Analysis of Data-Successfully was able to differentiate the data into positive or neutral or negative sentiment analysis. Data Cleaning- Data Cleaning has been done to check uppercase and lowercase characters and use of special characters like !,@ etc and scrapping of white spaces. We are comparing three algorithms based on accuracy.

FEATURES OFFERED
Web Scraping: Gathering review data from various online sources.
Data Cleaning And Preprocessing: Preparing text data for analysis.

CONCLUSION

This project inferred about the web scraping of data and using Naive bayes classifiers,SVR,KNN ,successfully demonstrated the accuracy . Identified trends and other insights in sentiment data Moreover,there was efficient extraction of data . Majority of the reviews were of positive sentiment analysis followed by negative sentiment analysis.
We infer that Naive bayes classifier has shown more accuracy than SVR and KNN.
